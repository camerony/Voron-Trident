## Power Inlet 1.2mm
This part replaces the `power_inlet_adamstech` part from the official [Voron repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/Voron-Trident/blob/main/STLs/Skirt/power_inlet_adamstech.stl). This part adapts specifically to 1.2mm AC inlets for a better fit.

## LDO Z Cable Anchor
The LDO deck panel has a Z cable opening that is in a slightly different position than the original. Use this part to match the anchor with the new opening.  

## LDO Deck Wire Cover Right
The LDO deck panel has a larger rear right opening. This part will cover the larger opening more completely. 

## Bed WAGO Mount
This part holds the 2x2 WAGO terminals as well as a 2x2 JST XH Splicing PCB for the build plate.
